- Take inventory of current images and containers `docker image ls`{{execute}} `docker container ls`{{execute}}
- Run hello-world image `docker container run hello-world`{{execute}}
- Look at the running containers `docker container ls`{{execute}}
- Look at all containers `docker container ls -a`{{execute}}

- Why does `hello-world` only show when the `-a` option is passed?
