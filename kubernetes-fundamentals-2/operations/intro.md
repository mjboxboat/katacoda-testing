Now that we've covered all of the basic Kubernetes objects, it is time to put this knowledge to the test, and start performing basic cluster operations. We can't cover everything you'll do as you administer a cluster, but we'll cover a good starting point.

This lab will include a review of deploying and managing the lifecycle of a Deployment, isolating objects via namespaces, and provide a quick introduction to Helm, the de-facto package manager for Kubernetes.
