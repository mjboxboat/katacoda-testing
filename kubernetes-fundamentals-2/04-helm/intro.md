Helm bills itself as the package manager for Kubernetes. It is a tool from the kubernetes community for templatizing and sharing deployment for Kubernetes. These deployments are called charts. Charts can easily be built and shared, and a curated catalog of stable and incubating charts is maintained by Helm.

Helm can be used to:
* Find and use popular software packaged as Helm charts to run in Kubernetes
* Share your own applications as Helm charts
* Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
* Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
* Manage releases of Helm packages
