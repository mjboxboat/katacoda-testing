Welcome to the final lab of Kubernetes Fundamentals II. In this lab, we will configure and deploy the Docker Voting App on Kubernetes. The Docker Voting app is a multi-tier application that lets you vote for your favorite animal, and track the results.

The goal of this lab is to use all of the skills we've learned to help translate high-level requirements into a Kubernetes deployment. Once the application is deployed, there are a few cluster operations to complete to finalize the deployment.

Working in groups of 2 (or 3) will yield the best results.
