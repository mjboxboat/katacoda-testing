In this step we will deploy a Service that exposes the HTTP server pods externally using NodePort.

This step will make the service/pods accessible externally (outside of the cluster) on any of the primary IPs of any node in the cluster.

Follow along and enter the below service specification in the service.yaml file on the right.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: http-server-nodeport-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: http-server-nodeport
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  sessionAffinity: None
```

Now let's apply the service file in Kubernetes.
- Deploy the service into k8s using the services.yaml file. `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`{{execute}}
- Check to make sure the service was deployed and what ClusterIP was assigned. `kubectl get svc -o wide`{{execute}}
- Run a curl against the ClusterIP shown for the http-server-service. `curl YOURCLUSTERIP` (*you will need to type this manually using the clusterip of your specific service*)
- Run the curl a few more times (press up arrow to show command again) and notice that each time you run it, a different pod behind the service responds.

You have now successfully deployed multiple pods and exposed them to the rest of the cluster using a ClusterIP. In the next section we will learn how to expose services/pods outside the cluster using NodePort.
